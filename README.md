# Fetal_health_classification

This project focuses on classification of fetal health based on a clinical tests by implementing machine learning models and choosing the best one.

Insights and conclusions:
Best Model XGBoost (F1 = 91.2%, 1.6% Std)
The model identifies unhealthy fetus (pathological) with an F1 score of 90.7%
ML models could be used to help identify fetal health

tools used: python, scikit-learn, xgboost, cat-boost, pandas
